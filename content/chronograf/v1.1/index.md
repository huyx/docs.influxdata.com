# A New Chronograf

We are excited to announce the release of the first open source version of Chronograf, the user interface component of the TICK stack.
With this 1.1-alpha release, we can now provide the entire stack as a fully open source monitoring solution.
Please read the [blog post from Paul Dix](https://www.influxdata.com/announcing-the-new-chronograf-a-ui-for-the-tick-stack-and-a-complete-open-source-monitoring-solution), our CTO, to understand how Chronograf is evolving and what to expect in the coming releases.

Note that the new [open source version of Chronograf](https://github.com/influxdata/chronograf) is not a continuation of the previous closed source product.
They address similar needs, so we have kept the name, but the code is all new.

## Getting Started

To get up and running with the new Chronograf, please visit the [README](https://github.com/influxdata/chronograf/blob/master/README.md) in the GitHub repository.
All documentation will live in that repository during the 1.1-alpha release.

## Bug Reports and Feature Contributions

To contribute to the bug reports, testing, and development of this new visualization, monitoring, and alerting product, please familiarize yourself with the [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/influxdata/chronograf/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) guide.
Your experience with Chronograf and feedback are indispensable as we
develop this product.

# The Old Chronograf

Users can continue to use the deprecated, closed source Chronograf product (versions 0.4 through 1.0).
The documentation is available under `Chronograf Versions` in the left hand navigation bar.

Please see the [Chronograf Product FAQ](/chronograf/v1.1/administration/chronograf-product-faq/) for additional information
about the Chronograf 1.1-alpha release.
